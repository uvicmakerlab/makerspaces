Bruce Sterling on Atemporality --> "Outside the timestream with the prepostmodern archaeofuturistic." [http://www.flickr.com/photos/brucesterling/sets/72157619722832388/](http://www.flickr.com/photos/brucesterling/sets/72157619722832388/)

And his talk on "Atemporality for the Creative Artist" at Transmediale 2010 themed "FUTURITY NOW!" [http://www.wired.com/beyond_the_beyond/2010/02/atemporality-for-the-creative-artist/](http://www.wired.com/beyond_the_beyond/2010/02/atemporality-for-the-creative-artist/)

Instead of an emphasis on "low tech," how about malleable tech, plastic tech, harmonics, wax or melts, which can be carved, used to cast things, re-used to make new things, or burnt away to cast something more permanent

Consider Tech & Harmonics: resonating, development/repurposing of tech as rings radiating from the present possibilities at hand 

Also consider histories of transduction: see Sterne and Igoe.
